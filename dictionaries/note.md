Here are some examples of uses of Python dictionaries:
1. Representing the state of a game board, with each key being a tuple of coordinates
2. Storing file modification times, with file names as keys
3. A digital telephone/address book

Keys are unique within a dictionary (and any other kind of mapping). 
Values do not need to be unique within a dictionary.
