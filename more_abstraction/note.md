#### Benefits of objects
- Polymorphism: You can use the same operations on objects of different classes, and they will work as if “by magic.”
- Encapsulation:You hide unimportant details of how objects work from the outside world.
- Inheritance: You can create specialized classes of objects from general ones.

#### Polymorphism
Basically, that means that even if you don’t know what kind of object a variable refers to, you may
still be able to perform operations on it that will work differently depending on the type (or
class) of the object.
