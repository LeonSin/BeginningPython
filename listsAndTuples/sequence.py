# Python has 6 built-in types of sequences:
# lists and tuples(most common)
# strings, Unicode strings, buffer objects, and 
# xrange objects.

# Main difference between lists and tuples is that you can change
# a list,but you can't change a tuple.
# That's why you may see built-in functions returning tuples.

# Common Sequence Operations

# Indexing
greeting = 'Hello'
print greeting[0]
print greeting[-1]
print 'Hello'[1] # string literal
